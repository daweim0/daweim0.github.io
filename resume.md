## Education: 
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, BS in computer Science and Computational Math

Graduated Spring 2020, Summa Cum Laude

## Work and Research Experience:

### Amazon Go: Software/Systems Engineer, 2022 - present
* Designed, wired, and programmed robots to test & characterize novel electromechanical devices
* Designed and implemented statistics to understand and grade prototype devices
* [in progress] Proposed, designed, and writing a system to automatically track actions by human test participants. Will massively reduce manual labor from manual data annotation, and provide richer ground-truth
* (sorry there aren't more specifics, my team's project is not publicly released)

### Microsoft: Software Engineer, 2020 - 2022
* Wrote analysis tools for Kubernetes log data, turned vast log data into actionable insights
* Enabled IoT device monitoring by writing a Prometheus metric collector for ARM and x86
* Contributed to a Kubernetes monitoring add-on, improved its reliability and rearchitecting to increase collection scale

### RPI Rock Raider: Vice President / Project Manager, 2016 - 2020
* Organized the team to attend IGVC in Summer 2019, our first competition in 5+ years. Won Rookie of the Year award
* Enabled faster development and debugging by setting up a Gazebo based simulator. Was a drop-in replacement for rover hardware
* Co-developed ROS software stack for autonomous navigation on a custom mobile base (based on ROS Navstack). Including fusing sensor data with very non-gaussian noise.
* Wrote ROS “drivers” for hardware including motor divers, IMU, and RTK GPS
* Wrote a highly accurate CNN with a custom (YOLOv3 inspired) architecture for pixel-level lane segmentation. Runs in 3ms per frame on 416x416 images on an embedded device (Nvidia Jetson Xavier)

### Microsoft: Software Engineering Intern, Summer 2019
* Wrote a data-driven memory leak detector for Kubernetes applications

### Olis Robotics: Robotics Intern, Summer 2018
* Designed and prototyped multiple migration strategies for conversion of an OpenCL codebase to CUDA, providing transparent interoperability between OpenCL and CUDA
* Reduced continuous integration (CI) system failures from regular occurrences to rare events by migrating a nightly build system to Amazon Web Services, making build workers stateless, and automating startup, configuration, and updating of build workers
* Combined two C++ codebases requiring mutually incompatible compilers under a single build system, allowing use of separate CPU and GPU compilers (to enable CUDA with legacy code)
* Wrote a flexible camera calibration utility to be included in a shipped product

### Neural Net Research Assistant, UW Robotics and State Estimation Lab, Summer 2017
* Designed and trained convolutional Neural Networks in the Tensorflow library that generated highly discriminative image features for pose recognition and optical flow
* Created an automated system to evaluate network structures and modified our existing codebase to allow adding new network structures without breaking compatibility with existing networks

### Robotics Research Assistant, University of Washington's Sensor Systems Lab, 2014 ‒ 2016
* Designed and implemented a machine learning based control algorithm and robot simulator for balancing under-actuated and unstable robots (applied to an "acrobot" robot)
* Wrote a fully instrumented simulator, with both visual and numeric analytic capabilities. Written in Python with C extensions (Cython) and the Open Dynamics Engine physics engine
