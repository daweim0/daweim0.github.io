I was heavily involved with RPI's premier robotics team, the Rock Raiders. I primairly worked on the robot software, which included:
<ol>
<li> A companion simulator. I wrote it to present the same APIs as our ROS device drivers, so it was a drop-in replacement for the robot hardware. It was incredibly usefulf when debugging our localization and navigation stack </li>
<li> Localization. I worked on our sensor fusion strategy, so deciding which sensors are fused into which coordinate frames, and how they were fed into our path planner and obstacle map. GPS was a lot less useful than I thought it would be</li> 
<li> Vision. <a href="url">IGVC</a> required driving within painted white lanes on a grassy field. I worked extensively on our lane detector </li>
<li> Hardware integration. This was mostly writing ROS nodes to communicate with sensors and motor drivers </li>
<li> Fixing random problems. For example, I found a bug in the firmware of our motor drivers where they would only output half power (it was very weird) </li>
</ol>

I also did electrical and mechanical work here-and-there.

	An earlier incarnation of Rockie, before we switched from URC to IGVC. Note the arm and rocker suspension, both of which were not needed for IGVC. This driving was under remote control, autonomoy wasn't functional on hardware yet.
