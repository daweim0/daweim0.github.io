Thanks for coming to my blog! It's been going since I was in high school. I graduated college in spring 2020 and currently at Microsoft writing logging and analysis tools for Kubernetes. I don't update this blog as often as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-michelman">LinkedIn</a>, but I put more photos here. (and who would choose walls of text over photos?) Please contact me if you'd like to talk about any of these or other projects! I can be reached at
<a href="mailto:davidmichelman@gmail.com">davidmichelman@gmail.com</a>

Here's some upcoming projects I'm thinking about:
<ul>
<il>A camera based tool tracker for my workshop with voice assistant integration (think "Alexa, where is the 4mm hex wrench?")</il>
<li>Human scale Alcubierre warp drive</li>
</ul>
