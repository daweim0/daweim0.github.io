A great little printer, was easy to put together.
</p>
<p class="body-copy">
This was one of the earliest 3d printers kits available and I assembled one back in 2012.  It was super useful
for printing parts for many projects.
</p>
<p class="body-copy">
We used the Replicator G software to prepare the model and drive the printer.  It worked pretty well.
</p>
<p class="body-copy">
One thing that was really nice was that it had a heated build platform, which helped very much as the models stuck to it,
rather than the bottom layer sticking to the following layers and coming up and following the extruder.
</p>
<p class="body-copy">
We sold it on Craigslist after I got the Ultimaker working since it has a bigger build platform
and uses PLA rather than ABS.
</p>
<p class="body-copy">
Unfortunately as this was a few years ago, records and photos have been lost to the sands of time.
